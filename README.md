## Features

*   **Multithreaded Scanning:**  Quickly scans ports using multiple threads for enhanced speed.
*   **Flexible Scanning Options:** Scan single ports, custom ranges, or all 65,535 TCP ports.
*   **Baseline Comparison:** Compares current scan results against a stored baseline to identify changes.
*   **Automated Baseline Creation:** Automatically generates a baseline on the first run.
*   **Optional Baseline History:**  Maintain a timestamped history of previous baselines (configurable).
*   **Clear Alerts:**  Provides notifications for newly opened and closed ports.
*   **Simple CLI Usage:** Easy-to-understand command-line interface.


## Requirements

*   Python 3.6 or higher


## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moranchay/port-scanner-baseline.git
    cd port-scanner-baseline
    ```

## Usage

The script uses command-line arguments to control its behavior.  Here are some examples:

* **Scan all ports on a target:**

    ```bash
    python scanner.py --all --target 192.168.1.10
    ```

* **Scan a specific port range on a target:**

    ```bash
    python scanner.py --range 22-443 --target 192.168.1.10
    ```

* **Update the baseline and keep historical data:**

    ```bash
    python scanner.py --update-baseline --keep-history
    ```

* **Update the baseline with a specified number of threads:**

    ```bash
    python scanner.py --update-baseline --keep-history --threads 400
    ```

* **Scan default ports (configurable in the script):**

    ```bash
    python scanner.py --target 192.168.1.10
    ```
